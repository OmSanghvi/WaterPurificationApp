            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Microplastics and plastic pollution are very harmful to various ecosystems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many small plastic particles, which often result from the breakdown of larger plastic waste, infiltrate aquatic ecosystems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Here, they are consumed by other animals and wildlife, leading to both physical and chemical harm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These animals mistake microplastics for food, which can cause internal injuries, and possibly death.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The accumulation of plastics in lakes affects biodiversity and the health of aquatic plants and animals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, microplastics can input harmful chemicals into the water, further deteriorating water quality and presenting risks to human health through the consumption of contaminated water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The tenacity of plastic waste and microplastics in the environment will cause detrimental effects that can last for many years, making it very important to address this issue.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Our product is a cutting-edge water purification system designed to effectively remove microplastics from water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It uses reverse osmosis, semi-permeable membranes, and organosilanes, which are compounds that chemically fix the microplastics by forming a solid hybrid silica.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The purification system contains a sensor that detects the presence of microplastics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If these particles are detected, the mechanism triggers the release of organosilanes in accurate amounts based on the concentration of microplastics on the semi-permeable membranes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the start, the water intake pump is closed to allow the organosilanes to interact with the microplastic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After one minute, a high-speed suction process collects both the microplastics and organosilanes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, the intake pump is opened to resume water filtration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In accordance with the water intake pump, a separate pump continuously expels the purified water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The semi-permeable membranes ensure that neither microplastics nor organosilanes pass through, and the reverse osmotic process pushes the water through these membranes, ensuring no water is left behind.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, our system is powered by solar energy to enhance both scalability and adaptability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using solar energy reduces maintenance costs and allows the system to be incorporated in remote locations where normal power sources are not available.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Microplastics are detrimental to the environment, by harming wildlife through ingestion, and posing negative impacts on water quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To address these problems, various techniques and compounds have been used, including sand filtration, activated carbon filtration, and membrane filtration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are various issues associated with these processes mainly being scalability and efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For example, sand filtration mainly filters larger particles, so it is not effective with removing small microplastics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our innovative approach corrects these imperfections in a unique way by integrating organosilanes into a water purification system.
